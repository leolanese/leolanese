<p>
  Throughout the last fifteen years, I have developed solid experience in Software Engineer, specialising in "Front-End" using `Angular` or pure `vanilla JS` and "Full-Stack" development paradigm focus on `NodeJS` and `Python` under `Agile` methodologies. 
</p>
<p>
   Over the course of my professional journey, I have been fortunate to reside and work in diverse countries and cultures, including: `Argentina`, `Spain`, `Germany`, and `United Kingdom` these days. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of global dynamics, but have also allowed me to forge meaningful connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I have had the distinct honor of presenting at prestigious JavaScript conferences worldwide, contributing as a reviewer for Angular books, and actively engaging with the vibrant JS community when invited for conferences. These endeavors have undoubtedly solidified my expertise in this dynamic field as a Developer but also as a Team player.

### What I'm doing as Senior Front-End / Full-Stack Engineer? 🚀

I'm responsable for a range of very important tasks as part of a Team. Here is what I do:

1. 🌟**Be nice**: `Be a developer that everybody wants to work with`. It's not all about the code.

2. 🌟**Show Strong Team Player Skills**: `Actively collaborate and integrate to promote team engagemen` and uphold company culture.

3. 🌟**Be curious**: As an `Software Engineering Manager or Software Engineer, your brain is your greatest asset`. Be actibly looking for new challenges, move out of comfortable zone and be eager to learn

4. 🌟**Deep understanding**: Do no create a solution that simply works. Understand all the implications. Understand how works internally. Reverse-enginner it, and explain to someone else like a child of nine. Now, understanding the problem let's provide a simplest and best possible solution. `Software Engineer is about provide a solution for a problem using tech.`

### What I'm doing as Senior Team Lead / Software Engineering Manager? 🚀

> Finding a truly exceptional leader is hard to find, parting with them is challenging and impossible to forget.

I'm responsible for a range of crucial tasks aimed at promoting growth, innovation, and success within the engineering team. Here is what I do:

1. 🌟**Servant Leader**: Servant is a `person who performs duties for others`. A `servant leader` is a person who `acts as a servant first, focusing on the needs and success of the team` because the primary role is to `serve and support the team members`, rather than exerting top-down authority

2. 🌟**Situational Leadership** It is an adaptable Model of leadership. Is based on the idea that the best way to lead a team is to match your leadership style to the needs of the individual parts of team, means `choosing the right leadership style for the right people`.

3. 🌟**Supporting Personal Growth**: I actively `mentor and guide` engineers (when need it) in their career development, helping them set goals and providing opportunities for skill enhancement. Here I'm using `Situational Leadership methodologies`

4. 🌟**Conflict Resolution**: I act as a mediator in conflicts, `employing situational leadership strategies to address internal and external conflicts effectively`. I'm using `Deal with Comflicts` trainning education and professional experience to deal with it.

5. 🌟**Motivation & Inspiration**: It's my role to `keep the team motivated and inspire them to consistently perform at their best`. Servant leaders consider the impacts of actions and decisions in the long-term, rely on persuasion rather than command and coercion to build influence. I integrate `Situational Leadership principles` to adapt motivational strategies based on individual and team dynamics

6. 🌟**Culture Building**: `Nurturing a healthy team culture is a priority`, and I iterate on processes and rituals to align with the team's working style while contributing to the evolution of the engineering culture.

7. 🌟**Continuous Improvement**: I focus on the long-term growth and development of team members and the organization. By encouraging a sense of ownership and responsibility among team members, I apply `Situational Leadership` to foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to take initiative and contribute effectively

8. 🌟**Technical & Personal Support**: Handling and mitigating technical & personal matters within the team, I promote ownership, influence, and effective communication with compassion: Sympathy enables us to feel sorrow for another's misfortune, while empathy allows us to understand and share their feelings. Compassionate leadership emerges from blending traditional leadership skills with a generous infusion of empathy, sympathy, and compassion.

9. 🌟**Promoting Knowledge Sharing**: I encourage a culture of knowledge sharing and communication, guiding the team towards adopting guiding principles, a growth mindset, and a proactive approach to addressing technical debt.

10. 🌟**Get individual & company clear values & purposes and find team-members integrity and the highest good as a goal**: Develop great teams, not just software.

In essence, SEM roles revolves around `leadership`, `mentorship`, `innovation` and `culture-building` to drive `both individual and collective success` within the engineering team and the broader organisation. By embracing `servant leadership`, `situational leadership` and `Agile` I can provide for an environment where the teams thrive, achieving remarkable results. 

> Always remember Leading is not about being at the top; it's about serving those who follow you 🙌

### 👨‍💻  What I'm doing at the moment: 
 - I'm currently helping in a UK Charity CYF `https://codeyourfuture.io/`. CodeYourFuture is an organization that helps people that are affected by forced diaspora to get back on track by teaching Web Development. I'm helping to make a positive impact on others peoples life. Sharing knowledge that can empower aspiring developers and contribute to the growth of the programming community.
 - Continue in an Angular path as well, as Angular is witnessing new exiting trends recently and looks very promising near future! Also continuing pushing the boundaries with `NodeJS` and `Python`. That encorage me to keep moving into the `Full-Stack` paradigm, leading to the expansion of frontiers in Software Development 👍
