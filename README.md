<p>
  Throughout the last fifteen years, I have developed solid experience in Software Engineer, specialising in "Front-End" using `Angular` or pure `vanilla JS` and "Full-Stack" development paradigm focus on `NodeJS` and `Python` under `Agile` methodologies. 
</p>
<p>
   Over the course of my professional journey, I have been fortunate to reside and work in diverse countries and cultures, including: `Argentina`, `Spain`, `Germany`, and `United Kingdom` these days. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of global dynamics, but have also allowed me to forge meaningful connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, I have had the distinct honor of presenting at prestigious JavaScript conferences worldwide, contributing as a reviewer for Angular books, and actively engaging with the vibrant JS community when invited for conferences. These endeavors have undoubtedly solidified my expertise in this dynamic field as a Developer but also as a Team player.

### What I'm doing as Senior Software Engineering Manager? 🚀

I'm responsible for a range of crucial tasks aimed at fostering growth, innovation, and success within the engineering team. Here's what I do:

1. **Servant Leader**: Servant is a `person who performs duties for others`. A `servant leader` is a person who `acts as a servant first, focusing on the needs and success of the team` because the primary role is to `serve and support the team members`, rather than exerting top-down authority

2. **Supporting Personal Growth**: I actively `mentor and guide` engineers (when need it) in their career development, helping them set goals and providing opportunities for skill enhancement. Here I'm using `Situational Leadership methodologies`

3. **Conflict Resolution**: I act as a mediator in conflicts, `employing situational leadership strategies to address internal and external conflicts effectively`. I'm using `Deal with Comflicts` trainning education and professional experience to deal with it.

4. **Motivation and Inspiration**: It's my role to `keep the team motivated and inspire them to consistently perform at their best`. Servant leaders consider the impacts of actions and decisions in the long-term, rely on persuasion rather than command and coercion to build influence. I integrate `Situational Leadership principles` to adapt motivational strategies based on individual and team dynamics

5. **Culture Building**: `Nurturing a healthy team culture is a priority`, and I iterate on processes and rituals to align with the team's working style while contributing to the evolution of the engineering culture.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: I focus on the long-term growth and development of team members and the organization. By encouraging a sense of ownership and responsibility among team members, I apply `Situational Leadership` to foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to take initiative and contribute effectively

7. **Technical & Personal Support**: Handling and mitigating technical & personal matters within the team, I promote ownership, influence, and effective communication with compassion: Sympathy enables us to feel sorrow for another's misfortune, while empathy allows us to understand and share their feelings. Compassionate leadership emerges from blending traditional leadership skills with a generous infusion of empathy, sympathy, and compassion.

8. **Promoting Knowledge Sharing**: I encourage a culture of knowledge sharing and communication, guiding the team towards adopting guiding principles, a growth mindset, and a proactive approach to addressing technical debt.

9. **Get individual & company clear values & purposes and find team-members integrity and the highest good as a goal**: Develop great teams, not just software.


In essence, SEM roles revolves around leadership, mentorship, innovation, and culture-building to drive both individual and collective success within the engineering team and the broader organisation.
By embracing servant leadership and Agile we can provide for an environment where our teams thrive, achieving remarkable results both individually and collectively.

### 👨‍💻  What I'm doing at the moment: 
 - I'm currently helping in a UK Charity CYF `https://codeyourfuture.io/`. CodeYourFuture is an organization that helps people that are affected by forced
diaspora to get back on track by teaching Web Development. I'm helping to make a positive impact on others peoples life. Sharing knowledge that can empower aspiring developers and contribute to the growth of the programming community.
 - Continue in an Angular path as well, as Angular is witnessing new exiting trends recently and looks very promising near future! Also continuing pushing the boundaries with `NodeJS` and `Python`. That encorage me to keep moving into the `Full-Stack` paradigm, leading to the expansion of frontiers in Software Development 👍
