  <h2> Hi, I'm Leo Lanese 👋 </h2>
  <h3>Senior Angular Developer  |  AI & Data-Driven UX</h3>

Senior `Angular Developer` & `JS Speaker` with `15+ years of UK contracting experience`. With a foundation in `Computer Systems Analysis` and `backed by 34+ professional recommendations`, I deliver scalable, high-performance, user-centric applications that improve usability and elevate product quality. 

I drive team velocity as a `Centaur-Engineer`, integrating AI-assisted tooling to automate commoditised tasks and compress development cycles. Specilising in `Angular and Front-End architecture`, my role goes beyond writing code, it's about crafting `high-performance`, `scalable user experiences`, that users not only love but also feel deeply connected to. By focusing on creating applications that users trust, rely on, and want to keep using, I aim to build products that truly resonate with their needs and improve their lives.<br />

## My History in a `console.log()` 💻:
<p>
Over the course of my 15+ year professional journey 🕰️, I have been fortunate to reside and work in diverse countries and cultures, including: Argentina 🇦🇷, Spain 🇪🇸, Germany 🇩🇪, and the United Kingdom 🇬🇧 these days. These experiences have not only enriched my understanding of global dynamics 🌍, but have also allowed me to forge meaningful connections with individuals from diverse backgrounds 🤝.

Additionally, I have had the distinct honor of presenting at prestigious JavaScript conferences worldwide 🎤, contributing as a reviewer for Angular books 📚, and actively engaging with the vibrant JS community when invited for conferences 🚀. These endeavors have undoubtedly solidified my expertise in this dynamic field—not just as a Developer 💻 with Analytics, but also as a Team Player 👥.
</p>

<p>
🎯 My Mission <br />
Problem-solving 🛠️: Dive in, tackle issues directly, and avoid unnecessary complexities.

🧠 My Philosophy <br />
Software Engineering 💻 is about providing solutions ✅ to problems ❓ through technology 🌐.
</p>
  
<br />

### What I'm doing as Senior Angular Front-End Developer ? 🚀

✅ 🌟**Be performante**: Write code with performance in mind. Write Good Simple Code. 

✅ 🌟**Be simple and testable**: `Hard to test. Not a great code`. 

✅ 🌟**Be insightful**: Deep Understanding, simple solution, but don't create a solution that simply works. Understand all the implications. Understand how works internally. Reverse-enginner it, and explain to someone else like a child of nine. Now, understanding the problem let's provide a simplest and best possible solution. 

✅ 🌟**Be Strong Team Player**: `Actively collaborate and integrate to promote team engagement` and uphold company culture.

✅ 🌟**Be curious**: As an `Software Engineer, our brain is our greatest asset`. Be actibly looking for new challenges, be curious, move out of comfortable zone and be eager to learn.

✅ 🌟**Be practical**: Code that's merely "smart" often is an atempt to show how "smart" the author is. However, in my experience, people value and appreciate more when you `focus on solving their problems and making their work easier, rather than showing off technical tricks`.

✅ 🌟**Be nice**: `Be a nice person, but above all a great person, that everybody wants to work with`. It's not 100% all about the code.

<br />  
 
### What I'm doing as Software Engineering Manager / SEM ? 🚀

> Finding a truly exceptional leader is hard to find, parting with them is challenging and impossible to forget.

As A SEM I'm responsible for a range of crucial tasks aimed at promoting growth, innovation, and success within the engineering team. Here is what I do:

✅ 🌟**Lead with Empathy rather than sympathy**: Having the experience of worked in person in a few different countries and cultures gave me a better perspective of "caring". Sympathizing is caring for another's feeling and suffering, whereas `empathy` goes beyond feeling compassion to being able to experience and relay their stories. Compassionate Leadership is the result of combining some traditional leadership tools and most importantly, presenting them from an "empathetic side" (also sympathy to a point), with large doses of compassion. 

✅ 🌟**Servant Leader**: Servant is a `person who performs duties for others`. A `servant leader` is a person who `acts as a servant first, focusing on the needs and success of the team` because the primary role is to `serve and support the team members`, rather than exerting top-down authority

✅ 🌟**Situational Leadership** It is an adaptable "Model of Leadership". Is based on the idea that the best way to lead a team is to match our leadership style to the needs of the individual parts of team, means `choosing the right leadership style for the right people`. I use my trainning and skills in `Situational Leadership` Model to flexible adapt into individual situations when need it

✅ 🌟**Supporting Personal Growth**: I actively `mentor and guide` engineers (when need it) in their career development, helping them set goals and providing opportunities for skill enhancement. Here I'm using `Situational Leadership methodologies`

✅ 🌟**Conflict Resolution**: I act as a mediator in conflicts, `employing situational leadership strategies to address internal and external conflicts effectively`. I'm using `Deal with Comflicts` trainning education and professional experience to deal with it.

✅ 🌟**Motivation & Inspiration**: It's my role to `keep the team motivated and inspire them to consistently perform at their best`. Servant leaders consider the impacts of actions and decisions in the long-term, rely on persuasion rather than command and coercion to build influence. I integrate `Situational Leadership principles` to adapt motivational strategies based on individual and team dynamics

✅ 🌟**Culture Building**: `Nurturing a healthy team culture is a priority`, and I iterate on processes and rituals to align with the team's working style while contributing to the evolution of the engineering culture.

✅ 🌟**Continuous Improvement**: I focus on the long-term growth and development of team members and the organization. By encouraging a sense of ownership and responsibility among team members, I apply `Situational Leadership` to foster an environment where individuals feel empowered to take initiative and contribute effectively

✅ 🌟**Promoting Knowledge Sharing**: I `encourage a culture of knowledge sharing and communication`, encoraging developers to share ideas and guiding the team towards adopting guiding principles, a growth mindset, and a proactive approach to addressing technical debt.

✅ 🌟**Get individual & company clear values & purposes and find team-members integrity and the highest good as a goal**: Develop great teams, not just software.

In essence, SEM roles revolves around `leadership`, `mentorship`, `innovation` and `culture-building` to drive `both individual and collective success` within the engineering team and the broader organisation. By embracing `servant leadership`, `situational leadership` and `Agile` I can provide for an environment where the teams thrive, achieving remarkable results. 

> Always remember: `Leading is not about being at the top; it's about serving those who follow you` 🙌

### 👨‍💻  What I'm doing at the moment: 
 - Continue in an Angular path as well, as Angular is witnessing new exiting trends recently and looks very promising near future! Also continuing pushing the boundaries and challenging myself with `AI` and `NestJS`. That encorage me to keep moving into the `Full-Stack` paradigm, leading to the expansion of frontiers in Software Development 👍 
 - I'm currently helping in a UK Charity CYF `https://codeyourfuture.io/`. CodeYourFuture is an organization that helps people that are affected by forced diaspora to get back on track by teaching Web Development. I'm helping to make a positive impact on others peoples life. Sharing knowledge that can empower aspiring developers and contribute to the growth of the programming community.
